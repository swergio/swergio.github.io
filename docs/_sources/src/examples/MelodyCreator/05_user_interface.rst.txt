05_user_interface.py
===============

To start all the components of this example and interact with the other components
we will create a ``05_user_interface.py``, which we can execute cell by cell with interactive python in VSCode or a ``05_user_interface.ipynb`` jupyter notebook with the same code.

In this script will start all other components and then define a component to enable user input to actively label new data.
To play the generated melodies we will use functions from the music_generator.py file which is inspired by https://github.com/kiecodes/generate-music.

First we import all required packages.

.. code-block:: python

    import uuid
    import socket
    from swergio  import Client, MESSAGE_TYPE, Trigger
    from swergio_toolbox.swarm_control import Swarm
    from music_generator import *

We will use the swarm class from the swergio toolbox to simplify the handling of multiple components at once. 
Of course we can also just start each component one by one by just running the according script.

The swarm class requires a swarm.yaml file, that contains the specification about each component most importantly the path to each script.
Once the YAML is defined we run each component at once by instantiating a swarm object and calling the ``swarm.start()`` method.

.. code-block:: python

    swarm = Swarm()
    swarm.start()

After all the components are running, we can define our user component that will handle the labelling of new data.
We will set up a swergio client with a name and the same information as before and also join the *control* room.

.. code-block:: python

    COMPONENT_NAME = 'user'
    PORT = 8080
    SERVER = socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname())
    ADDR = (SERVER, PORT)
    FORMAT = 'utf-8'
    HEADER_LENGTH = 10

Now let's define a few settings for playing the generate melody including the key, scale and bpm.

We need to start a pyo server to be able to hear the sound.
Then we can create the swergio client and add it to the *control* room. 

.. code-block:: python

    num_steps = 1
    pauses = True
    key = 'C'
    scale= 'major'
    root = 4 
    bpm = 128
    s = Server().boot()
    client = Client(COMPONENT_NAME,SERVER,PORT,FORMAT,HEADER_LENGTH)
    client.join_room('control')

For the labeling process we will define a handler that is trigger once the *user* gets a new message including genomes to label.

We convert the genome to a pyo event and play it. While listening the user can give input about his rating between 0 and 5 for the melody.

Once all examples are labeled we send back the genomes including the ratings as fitness.

.. code-block:: python

    def label(msg):
        if "GENOMES" in msg.keys():
            genomes = msg["GENOMES"]
            ratings = []
            for genome in genomes:
                events = genome_to_events(genome, NUM_BARS, NUM_NOTES, num_steps, pauses, key, scale, root, bpm)
                for e in events:
                    e.play()
                s.start()
                rating = input("Rating (0-5)")
                for e in events:
                    e.stop()
                s.stop()
                ratings.append(float(rating))
            return {"GENOMES": msg["GENOMES"], "FITNESS": ratings}
    client.add_eventHandler(label,MESSAGE_TYPE.DATA.CUSTOM,responseRooms='user',trigger=Trigger(MESSAGE_TYPE.DATA.CUSTOM,'user'))

Finally lets create a function that will send the command to start the evolutionary process.

.. code-block:: python

    def start():
        msg = {'ROOT_ID':uuid.uuid4().hex, 
            'ID':uuid.uuid4().hex,
            'TYPE': MESSAGE_TYPE.DATA.CUSTOM.id, 
            'CMD': 'START',
            'TO_ROOM': 'control'
        } 
        client.send(msg)

We can now start the generation of music and listen to the messages when we need to provide new labels.

.. code-block:: python

    start()
    client.listen()

Finally we can stop all the components (Server, ControlModel, Trebuchet and Trainer) all  at once with  the ``swarm.stop()`` method.

.. code-block:: python

    swarm.stop()

Welcome to the documentation of the swergio project!
=====================================================

The swergio project is a prove of concept to enable forward and backward communication between independent machine learning components via websocket.
This approach allows us to integrate data science and ML models better into the full end-to-end business process.
The project contains multiple python and julia packages to help us with the implementation as well as a few use case examples.
